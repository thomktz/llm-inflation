    Implements the Lapeyres Aggregation algorithm.
    
    Lapeyres Aggregation algorithm:
    1) Take the index values of the children of node 'c', and divide each value by the value of the last December of the previous year.
    2) For each children, this value is multiplied by the current-year weight of the children node.
    3) These values are summed among the children to obtain the evolution of the parent node.
    4) Finally, the value is multiplied by the last December value of the previous year of the parent node.
    
    The algorithm presented here takes a different but ultimately equivalent approach:
    1) Compute the log returns of the index values of the children of node 'c'.
    2) Compute their intra-year cumulative sums.
    3) For each children, this value is multiplied by the current-year weight of the children node.
    4) These values are summed among the children to obtain the evolution of the parent node.
    5) The resulting time-series is exponentiated to get levels.
    6) Finally, the value is scaled by the last December value of the previous year of the parent node.
